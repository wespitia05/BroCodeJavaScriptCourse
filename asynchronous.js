// synchronous = executes line by line consecutively in a sequential manner
//               code that waits for an operation to complete

// asynchronous = allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting
//                doesn't block the execution flow and allows the program to continue
//                (I/O operations, network requests, fetching data)
//                handled with: callbacks, promises, async/await
